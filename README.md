# LinkedList

A LinkedList in C# is a collection of elements organized in a sequence in which each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This data structure is different from array-based lists, such as List<T>, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

LinkedLists in C# are defined in the System.Collections.Generic namespace and provide a series of operations to manage and manipulate elements in the linked list.
