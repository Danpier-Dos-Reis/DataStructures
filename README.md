# Queues

The Queue class in the _System.Collections **library**_ of the _.NET Framework_ is a collection that represents a queue-like data structure. A queue is a collection of elements that follows a "first in, first out" (FIFO) policy, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first to be removed.
